		<h1>Health Benefits</h1>
			<p>Evidence has shown that microgreens are high in antioxidant content, which can help prevent a range of diseases as well as boost mental and physical well-being. Such benefits depend on the microgreens that are consumed. For example, the <i>Brassica,</i> family which includes broccoli, contains vitamin E and a phenolic antioxidant.</p> 
			<p>In fact, research comparing microgreens to more mature greens, has shown that nutrient levels in microgreens can be up to nine times higher than those found in mature greens. Growing microgreens could be a better way of providing city dwellings with local seasonal vegetables as they are easy to grow at home in a small space.</p>
